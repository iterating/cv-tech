I have no problem taking the time to learn something well and apply it to any given task

After developing a variety of tools for clients, I completed intensive training in professional software development to enhance my development experience with enterprise-level best practices and Agile methodologies,strengthening my ability to contribute to large-scale projects and cross-functional teams. I spend my time learning software architecture, design principles, and best practices to ensure high-quality code delivery.

# Snow Removal
        Built microservice features in Typescript and React to facilitate successful interactions between customers, workers, and management that handle the complex logistics of snow removal delivery, growing the company from 4 employees to the largest snow removal company in Boston within 5 years though automated dispatch and real-time tracking capabilities.
        - Architected and implemented distributed microservices using TypeScript and Node.js, with domain-driven design principles and event-driven communication, integrated with a React frontend for optimal scalability and maintainability
        - Developed tool matching snow removal order locations with worker addresses utilizing Typescript and Google Cloud API, allowing efficient dispatch during snow events
        - Implemented robust security infrastructure with JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and API gateway patterns to ensure secure data access across microservices
        - Utilized a high-performance data architecture using MongoDB with geospatial indexing and RESTful API patterns, enabling real-time operational analytics and dispatch optimization
        - Currently continuing role on part-time basis.

## Reserarch
  Demonstrated an innovative approach to transplant immunology where a chemokine that plays a role in protecting cancer cells from immune attack is instead applied to prolong survival of transplant graft by locally attracting regulatory T cells and repelling cytotoxic T cells. 

  - Transplanted encapsulated islet cells with either Treg attractant CXCL12 or control alginate into diabetic mouse model. Then monitored the blood glucose of experimental and control groups and applied statistical testing to evaluate how CXCL12-incorporated encapsulants supported islet graft survival.  
  - Conducted research on a mycobacterial Hsp70-containing fusion protein targeting mesothelin, showing its ability to boost antitumor immunity and extend survival in mouse models of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma by attracting cytotoxic T cells to solid tumors.        - Transplanted encapsulated islet cells with either Treg attractant CXCL12 or control alginate into diabetic mouse model.
