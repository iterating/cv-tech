  title: Why me?
  summary: |
    I'm a web developer rooted in domain driven design and resilience.
    Previously in medicine, I found myself frequently combining domain knowledge with programming skills to build tools for myself and others, and switched careers to software development to focus on building my skills. Skilled in microservice architecture and a wide array of technologies including TypeScript, Python, GraphQL, React, and LangChain. I believe in taking the time to learn something well and apply it to any given task.
