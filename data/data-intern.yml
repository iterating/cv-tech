  title: Experiences
  info:
    - role: Software Engineering Intern
      time: 2024 - Present
      company: LA Film Lab, Los Angeles CA
      details: |
        Developed customer and internal-facing software for film lab using JavaScript, TypeScript, Nuxt, Node.js, and Firebase, translating real-time business needs into functional applications through a Lean design methodology. Collaborated with senior developer to successfully implement features in production.
        - Optimized and scaled web performance by implementing techniques such as lazy loading, asynchronous programming, and efficient resource management, resulting in improved load times and user experience.
        - Built robust, maintainable codebases by utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, PRPL, and other design patterns to ensure performance, code quality, and efficient development workflows.
        - Implemented RESTful and Server-Sent Events (SSE) APIs for real-time data updates, improving system performance and enabling seamless, low-latency communication between client and server.
        - Designed and developed an internal labeling system for customer order management using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript, improving employee workflow efficiency by 25% and streamlining the order management process.

    - role: Clinical User Specialist
      time: 2014 - 2015
      company: Vecna Healthcare, Burlington MA
      details: |
        Translated complex clinical workflows into intuitive, seamless user interfaces for an electronic medical record product using Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, and MySQL in Linux environments
        - Designed and prototyped Bootstrap user interfaces with Javascript, HTML, and CSS to meet the needs of healthcare providers and improve patient care outcomes, collaborating closely with engineering team 
        - Acted as a liaison between software developers and clinical users, conducting usability testing and gathering feedback from clinical end-users to identify pain points and areas for improvement, leading to iterative design enhancements.
        - Configured, administered, and maintained Ubuntu and Debian laptops in clinical settings with Ansible, ensuring secure access to essential healthcare applications and supporting CI/CD.
        - Upgraded and monitored clinical IT infrastructure, achieving near 100% uptime and minimizing disruptions to critical healthcare operations.


    - role: Research Assistant in Vaccine Immunology
      time: 2011 - 2013
      company: Vaccine Immunotherapy Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston MA
      details: |
        Demonstrated an innovative approach to transplant immunology where a chemokine that plays a role in protecting cancer cells from immune attack is instead applied to prolong survival of transplant graft by locally attracting regulatory T cells and repelling cytotoxic T cells. 
        - Utilized **Python** to perform statistical analyses of data from in-vitro and microarray experiments, including **SciPy** for ANOVA and T-tests, **Pandas** to structure data, and **Matplotlib** to visualize data for presentation
        - Programmed 'Cellbot', an automated cell counting program in **Java** and ImageJ, improving efficiency and accuracy of data collection, leading to a 25% improvement in data collection time. 
        - Transplanted encapsulated islet cells with either Treg attractant CXCL12 or control alginate into diabetic mouse model. Then monitored the blood glucose of experimental and control groups and applied statistical testing to evaluate how CXCL12-incorporated encapsulants supported islet graft survival.  
        - Conducted research on a mycobacterial Hsp70-containing fusion protein targeting mesothelin, showing its ability to boost antitumor immunity and extend survival in mouse models of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma by attracting cytotoxic T cells to solid tumors. 

        __Communication and Presentation:__
        - Documented and presented quantitative data for publication and peer review, leading to successful publication.
        - Presented project, theory, and findings to both technical subject experts and general clinical audience at conferences including Massachusetts General Hospital Presentation Day and Digestive Disease Interventions.

        __Publication:__
           Alginate encapsulant incorporating CXCL12 supports long term allo and xenoislet transplantation without systemic immune suppression. *American Journal of Transplantation*, 2015. [DOI 10.1111/ajt.13049](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25693473/)
