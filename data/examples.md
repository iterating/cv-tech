Seasoned software architect and engineering manager with 13+ years of experience

I'm a great team player, aware of the products and team's goals and concentrated on delivering features with great quality and customer satisfaction. I'm self-motivated and always aimed at improving my skills and knowledge. Never afraid of new challenges because you learn the most from them. 

Quality has been my main focus and direction in every project in my career.

From Architect point of view:
by researching technologies; designing robust and scalable architectures; communicating with stakeholders and pushing for defining and following a long-term vision; improving DevEx; sharing know-how

From a team lead's point of view:
by being transparent, showing dedication, improving the team morale, shielding from stress or external forces and coaching my team to realize their full potential; by introducing various agile techniques and tools like Kaizen and Scrum, automation and waste reduction by Value Stream Mapping.

From Dev point of view : 
by being the go-to technical expert, thorough code reviews, best practices, design patterns or test-driven development and impeccable bug-free code; by writing maintainable automated tests
